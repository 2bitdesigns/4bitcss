<div style='text-align:center;font-size:1.1em'>

<p>
4bitcss is a collection of CSS3 Color Palettes.
</p>

<p>
Each palette defines 16 beautiful bits of color <br/>
(and a background, foreground, and sometimes a cursorColor)
</p>

<br/>

It turns terminal color schemes into CSS variables and a fairly simple stylesheet.

<br/>

It is based off of the <a href='https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes'>amazing iTerm2-Color-Schemes repository by @mbadalato</a>

<br/>

There are currently {{site.data.Palettes | size}} palettes.
