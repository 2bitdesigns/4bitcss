# 4BitCSS

Color Schemes are an important part of web design.

Unfortunately, there's not too many great repositories of simple color schemes.

Luckily, console nerds have been hacking at this problem for some time.

[@mbadalato keeps a wonderful repository of color schemes for terminals](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes).

4BitCSS generates .css schemes for all schemes in this repository, and allows you to create your own with Export-4BitCss.

Check out [https://4bitcss.com](https://4bitcss.com) for some sweet samples.
